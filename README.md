# Black Friday Sales Analysis - Exploring Customer Behavior and Purchase Patterns

In this project, I aim to dive into the Black Friday dataset to uncover meaningful insights into customer behavior, product preferences, and overall sales patterns during the annual Black Friday shopping event. By leveraging exploratory data analysis techniques, I seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data and draw valuable conclusions that can inform business strategies for future Black Friday campaigns.
